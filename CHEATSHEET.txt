## FAQ
### Didn't Laser Blade support OptiFine's Dynamic Lights before?
Yes, it did. However, the Dynamic Lights currently ignore items added by mods. This issue has already been reported to the OptiFine developer, so please wait for them to fix it.

### What are items like Energy Cell, Medium, Blade Emitter, Casing, and Blueprint for? Planning to add a Laser Blade recipe that uses them? 
These items are for players to customize Laser Blade recipes with JSON files for data packs,or scripts for CraftTweaker, so I don't plan to add any recipes using them to the mod.
