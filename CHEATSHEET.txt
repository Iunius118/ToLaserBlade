## FAQ
### Didn't Laser Blade support OptiFine's Dynamic Lights before?
Use H1 or later.

### What are items like Energy Cell, Medium, Blade Emitter, Casing, and Blueprint for? Planning to add a Laser Blade recipe that uses them?
These items are for players to customize Laser Blade recipes with JSON files for data packs,or scripts for CraftTweaker, so I don't plan to add any recipes using them to the mod.
